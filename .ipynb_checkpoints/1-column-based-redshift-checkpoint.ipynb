    "In this lesson, we learned about the difference betweeen row based and column based storage and how redshift improves the performance of queries through column based storage.  First, we saw that through storing a single column of data per data block, redshift can only load up specificallyÂ queried columns, and avoid reading extra data into memory.  Then we saw that because data stored in together is of the same type, it can compress the data to save disk space.  Finally, we saw that redshift, stores in memory the minimum and max values in a data block -- via zone maps -- so that it does not have to scan each data block when performing a query."

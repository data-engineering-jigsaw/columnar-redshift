    "As we know, redshift is used to store our data for our analytical database.  And as we've discussed, our analytical queries are normally performed by querying the data along a column, as opposed to selecting a single row.  Because of this, redshift provides column based storage.  In this lesson, we'll describe what this means and see some of the benefits that this provides. "

    "If we performed a query of say `SELECT title FROM movies WHERE year = 1994`, we may have to search for the matching records through a movies table that is millions of records long, stored across multiple data blocks.  To avoid searching through every single data block, Redshift keeps track of minimum and maximum of a data block in memory.  This way it knows if the value is in the data block's range.  \n",

    "In this lesson, we learned about the difference betweeen row based and column based storage and how redshift improves the performance of queries through column based storage.  First, we saw that through storing a single column of data per data block, redshift can only load up specificallyÂ queried columns, and avoid reading extra data into memory.  Then we saw that because data stored in together is of the same type, it can compress the data to save disk space.  Finally, we saw that redshift, stores in memory the minimum and max values in a data block -- via zone maps -- so that it does not have to scan each data block when performing a query."
